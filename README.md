# SelfFlyingDrone

The goal of this project was to create a Drone simulation such that new drone enthusiasts could learn how to fly one without wrecking one and costing themselves hundreds of dollars. 

At the time of creating this README, I realized I would need to refactor the entire code base with new design principles, along with moving it to REACT. 

The collisions folder are all the algorithms I implemented to solve the problem of collision detection. 
In my final project, which will be under the repository "Drone Simulation", I will most likely use SAT for the detection, and Octrees/Bounding boxes for queries.
