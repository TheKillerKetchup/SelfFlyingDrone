this is a comprehension project. 
it will be a self driving drone that needs to get to ships randomly spread across a huge ocean
there will be random objects here and there that it can sense. 
It must not crash into these objects.

BONUSES:
- Add moving objects(like birds!)
- make multiple drones interact with eachother(trade battery for money?)
- add battery
- give it missions that give it a random amount of money. 
    - implement DP for it to search the best path to make money
- implement weather
- allow the user to select different drones, and perhaps take control
- make it 3d
- use real physics / flight dynamics
- give it a map
