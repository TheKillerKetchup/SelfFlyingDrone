use normal vectors
- triple cross product
- all normals for both shapes
    - axis parallel with the normals
    - min,max along axis using vertices
    - isnt this n^2 then -> checking all vertices for all normals
    - if axis has an overlap between min and max, then we continue
    - if an axis seperates them, then we know they don't collide
    - if all of the axises overlap, then we know they do collide
- if its a circle then there is one axis, that moves from the center of the circle to the center of the polygon
